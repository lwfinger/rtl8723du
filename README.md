```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rtw89-dkms-git.git
cd rtw89-dkms-git
makepkg -sri
```
If any of the packages above are not found check if your distro installs them like that.

##### Installation

##### How to unload/reload a Kernel module
 ```bash
sudo modprobe -rv 8723du         #This unloads the module
